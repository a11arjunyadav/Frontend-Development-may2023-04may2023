        <p>Delhi minister Saurabh Bharadwaj on Friday said that the water of the Yamuna River still entering through a breach at a regulator of the Irrigation and Flood Control Department. The regulator suffered damage near the Indraprastha bus stand and the WHO Building on Drain No 12, exacerbating the already dire situation.</p>
        <p>The compromised regulator allowed the Yamuna water to flow back towards the city, and on Thursday night, the flood water reached close to the Supreme Court due to the possible backflow of water from drains. Some portions of Mathura Road and Bhagwan Das Road near the Supreme Court were flooded.</p>
        <p>Kejriwal said the breach is causing flooding in ITO and surroundings.</p>
        <p>"I have directed the Chief Secretary to seek help of Army/NDRF but this shud be fixed urgently," he said in a tweet.</p>
        <p>Bharadwaj, Irrigation and Flood Control minister in the AAP-led Delhi government, rushed to the scene Thursday evening to oversee the evolving situation.</p>
